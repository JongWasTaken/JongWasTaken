### Languages
I consider myself proficient in all of these languages:
- C#
  - My favorite programming language
- Java
  - My most used language due to my focus on Minecraft
- Python
  - Mostly used for prototyping and scripting
- JavaScript
  - Mainly because of [easympv](https://github.com/JongWasTaken/easympv), which only supports ES5! I kinda dislike web-development...
